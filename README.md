Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
you have 5 turns to guess my number:
  > 50
too low ... you have 4 turns to guess my number:
  > 80
too high ... you have 3 turns to guess my number:
  > 75
too high ... you have 2 turns to guess my number:
  > 60
too low ... you have 1 turns to guess my number:
  > 68
too low ... You ran out of turns
the number was 73
